Starting in 2021, I will be heading the **Machine Learning in Medical Image Analysis Group**
at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/) funded by the [Cluster of Excellence - Machine Learning for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/).

## Research Areas

My research focuses on developing machine learning methodologies that bridge the gap between ML theory and clinical application. I am pursuing this goal along those broad directions:

 * **Safety and uncertainty**: In medical image analysis, confidently predicting something false can have devastating consequences. I aim to develop machine learning algorithms that reflect the various uncertainties in the medical image analysis pipeline and can help clinical practitioners to safely use this technology in practice.

 * **Learning efficiently with fewer data**: Obtaining annotated data is very expensive in the medical field because only clinical professionals can do it. How can we learn with fewer data, and how can we obtain training data that are optimal for a certain task?

 * **Exploiting shared information between tasks**: Often algorithms are learned from scratch for each new problem. Taking into account that many problems are related in various ways can help us create more intelligent algorithms.

 * **Discovering effects in big medical data**: Recent advances in probabilistic machine learning techniques offer a unique opportunity to explore datasets with ten thousands of images (such as the [German National Cohort Study](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/radiologische-klinik/klinik-fuer-diagnostische-und-interventionelle-radiologie/forschung/research-projects/the-german-national-cohort)) to better understand disease processes.

The research group will be focused on developing theoretically founded machine learning techniques in order to deploy medical image analysis algorithms safely in clinical practice.

## Short Bio

In 2020, I have been working in a research engineering role at [PTC Vuforia](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/vuforia), where I got the opportunity to work on the translation of machine learning technology into a product. Prior to this, I was a Post-doc at the [Biomedical Image Computing Group](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich working with Prof. [Ender Konukoglu](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~kender/), and before in the [Biomedical Image Analysis Lab](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) with Prof. [Daniel Rueckert](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/dr/). I completed my PhD in 2016 under the joint supervision of [Prof. Andy King](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/andrew-king) and Prof. Daniel Rueckert at King's College London in the [School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis). I obtained my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering and my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering from ETH Zürich.
