I am an Assistant Professor for Health Data Science in the [Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine](https://www.unilu.ch/en/faculties/faculty-of-health-sciences-and-medicine/) at the [University of Lucerne](https://www.unilu.ch), where I am leading the research group for [Medical AI](https://baumgach.github.io/mia-website/). Prior to joining the University of Lucerne, I was an independent research group leader in the [Cluster of Excellence - Machine Learning for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/university/), and part of my group remains in Tübingen.

My main research focus is on developing and applying ML technology for the analysis of healthcare data. My main research goals are to identify which criteria ML needs to fulfill to be clinically useful and solve the ML problems that prevent us from getting there. Specifically, my group is working on problems like learning from small datasets, robustness and uncertainty quantification, interpretable ML, and generative modelling of large medical datasets. 

<!-- Research Areas
======
My research focuses on developing machine learning methodologies that bridge the gap between ML theory and clinical applications. Specifically, I am interested in technologies facilitating human-AI collaboration, as well as using probabilistic modelling to discover disease effects and connections between clinical variables. I am pursuing those goals along the following directions:

 * **Safety and uncertainty**: In medical image analysis, confidently predicting something false can have devastating consequences. Hence, it is crucial to develop machine learning algorithms that reflect the various uncertainties in the medical image analysis pipeline and can help clinical practitioners to safely use this technology in practice.

* **Learning efficiently with fewer data**: Obtaining annotated data is very expensive in the medical field because only clinical professionals can do it. How can we learn with fewer data, and how can we obtain training data that are optimal for a certain task? 

* **Interpretable machine learning**: It is clear that artificial intelligence is in no position to replace clinicians and will not be for a long time, if ever. Therefore, we must develop techniques to allow clinicians and patients to optimally interface with machine learning algorithms. One important aspect of this question is making algorithmic decision processes transparent.

* **Human-in-the-loop systems**: Humans are an essential component in every ML system in multiple ways: they provide training data, they select and train the model, they operate the system. Thus it makes sense to put emphasis on the human role in this process for instance by developing techniques for reducing annotation effort, active learning, and interactive predictions. 

* **Exploiting shared information between tasks**: Often algorithms are learned from scratch for each new problem. Taking into account that many problems are related in various ways can help us create more intelligent algorithms. 

 * **Discovering effects in big medical data**: Recent advances in probabilistic machine learning techniques offer a unique opportunity to explore datasets with ten thousands of images (such as the [German National Cohort Study](https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/radiologische-klinik/klinik-fuer-diagnostische-und-interventionelle-radiologie/forschung/research-projects/the-german-national-cohort)) to better understand disease processes. -->

Short Bio
======
Since February 2024 I am an Assistant Professor in Health Data Science at the University of Lucerne. From February 2021 I was leading an independent research group at the University of Tübingen, a position which I still maintain. Before that I was working in a senior research engineering role at [PTC Vuforia](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/vuforia), where I focused on research and development of machine learning technology for augmented reality applications. Prior to this, I was a Post-doc at the [Biomedical Image Computing Group](https://bmic.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zürich working with [Prof. Ender Konukoglu](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~kender/), and before in the [Biomedical Image Analysis Lab](https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/) with [Prof. Daniel Rueckert](http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/dr/). I completed my PhD in 2016 under the joint supervision of [Prof. Andy King](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/andrew-king) and Prof. Daniel Rueckert at King's College London in the [School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis) ([link to PhD thesis](files/phd_thesis.pdf)). I obtained my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering and my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology and Electrical Engineering from ETH Zürich.
