## Academic Job Opportunities

I am currently hiring for an excellent PhD student interested in doing cutting
edge research at the intersection of medical image analysis and machine
learning.

Until Nov 2, 2020 you will have the opportunity to apply through the
prestigious [International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/).
Successful candidates will not only be able to perform research in one of the
most vibrant environments for machine learning research in the world, but will
also receive lots of career development support and training workshops.
The entire program is in English and applications by international students are
very welcome.

Women and people from diverse backgrounds are very much encouraged to apply!

The applications will be handled together with [Prof. Philipp Berens](http://www.eye-tuebingen.de/berens/),
who will be the official contact person during the application process. In case of interest, please contact
me directly via [email](mailto:c.f.baumgartner@gmail.com) or any other channel.
