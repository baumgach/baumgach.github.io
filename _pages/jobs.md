## Academic Job Opportunities

We currently have the following two openings in our group:

### Doctoral-Position (m/f/d, E13 TV-L; 65%) in Robust Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis
to be filled as soon as possible.

#### Project description
The aim of this project is to develop rigorous, mathematically founded techniques to assess the robustness of automated medical image analysis systems and to investigate methods for providing provable guarantees of an algorithms performance under variations in the image acquisition process.

Medical imaging data frequently are subject to systematic changes in appearance originating from different acquisition parameters or different imaging hardware. Unfortunately, modern deep learning systems have been shown to be extremely sensitive to such variations, to the point where an algorithm trained with data from one hospital, may not work on data acquired at a different hospital. Formally assessing the robustness of machine learning methods, building more robust techniques, and providing guarantees for the performance of such techniques is of utmost importance for these methods to be eventually deployed in clinical practice. Thus, the successful candidate will contribute directly to one of the big unsolved problems hindering wide-spread adoption of AI technology for medical image analysis.

#### Who we are looking for
You are curious, enjoy analytical thinking and have a passion for science. You have a strong motivation to do machine learning research as well as a keen interest to solve real-world clinical problems. You hold a M.Sc. degree (or similar) in machine learning, mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science, or similar fields. Ideally, you have prior experience with deep neural networks, and strong programming skills in Python.

#### What we offer
This is a project jointly supervised by [Dr. Christian Baumgartner](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/ml-in-medical-image-analysis/) and [Prof. Matthias Hein](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/maschinelles-lernen/team/prof-dr-matthias-hein/), and thus is truly at the intersection between state-of-the-art machine learning and medical image analysis. The successful candidate will work at the [Cluster of Excellence "Machine Learning - New Perspectives for Science"](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) and will benefit from this vibrant research environment as well as from the activities and events organized by the cluster and associated institutions.

#### About Tübingen
Tübingen is a scenic university town on the Neckar river in South-Western Germany. The quality of life is exceptionally high and the atmosphere is diverse, inclusive, and most locals speak English. Tübingen offers excellent research opportunities due to the University, four Max Planck institutes, the University Hospital, and Europe’s largest AI research consortium. You can find out more about Tübingen here: <https://www.tuebingen.de/en/>.

#### How to apply
Please send a cover letter, your CV, the names and email addresses of 2-3 referees, and copies of your University transcripts to Christian Baumgartner (<christian.baumgartner@uni-tuebingen.de>). If you have any questions about the position, please do not hesitate to contact Christian directly. The university seeks to raise the number of women in research and teaching and therefore urges qualified women scientists to apply for these positions. Equally qualified applicants with disabilities will be given preference. The employment will be carried out by the central administration of the University of Tübingen. Please submit your application by May 2nd, 2021.

### Postdoctoral Researcher (E13 TV-L, m/f/d) or PhD Student (E13 TV-L, 65%, m/f/d)
starting as soon as possible. 

How can we bring machine learning technology to clinical medical imaging practice? This is the main question the [Machine Learning in Medical Image Analysis (MLMIA)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/ml-in-medical-image-analysis/) group led by Dr. Christian Baumgartner tries to answer. Far from being solved, this question requires novel and creative approaches to numerous hard machine learning challenges. The main research focus of the MLMIA group is the development of methods that enable collaboration between humans and AI systems, in particular techniques for uncertainty quantification, interpretabiliy of predictions, and human-in-the-loop systems. A further focus is the application of generative modeling approaches to large medical imaging cohorts in order to better understand physiological and pathological processes and their connection to extraneous factors.

The successful PhD candidate will be working on interpretatable machine learning (but there is a lot of flexibility to accommodate the candidates personal interests). The successful postdoc candidate will be given the opportunity to shape their own research agenda within the confines of the group's motivation.

#### What we are looking for
You either hold a PhD, M.Sc., or equivalent degree in a quantitative discipline such as computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics, electrical engineering, or biomedical engineering. You are self-driven, curious, and enjoy analytical thinking. You have a strong motivation to do machine learning research as well as a keen interest to solve real-world clinical problems. Ideally, you have prior experience with machine learning, and strong programming skills in Python. Prior experience working with medical imaging data is a plus, but not required.

#### What we offer
The MLMIA group is located in the machine learning building of the University of Tübingen, together with the [Cluster of Excellence “Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science”](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/), which the group is part of, and [Tübingen AI Center](https://tuebingen.ai/). As such, the successful candidate will be embedded in an extraordinarily vibrant machine learning community in which regular exchanges of ideas and collaborations are common. The MLMIA group also greatly values the direct exchange with clinical partners from the [University Hospital Tübingen](https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/en-de/startseite) with which we have several ongoing collaborations.
